Bank Marketing Subscription Prediction System

Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit offered by a bank through telemarketing campaigns using Machine Learning techniques.

Dataset
The project uses the "Bank-direct-marketing-campaigns" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes information about customers' personal and financial attributes, as well as the outcome of previous and current contacts.

Tools and Libraries Used
NumPy: For numerical operations
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn (sklearn): For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation

Steps Involved
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis to identify patterns and insights.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Building and comparing various machine learning algorithms. Ultimately, an ensemble classifier was built combining different models.
Logistic Regression: Used as the primary predictive model due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model's performance is compared with other baseline models.

Insights
The project provides insights into the factors that influence a customer's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. It also suggests ways to improve the bank's marketing strategy based on the analysis.

Conclusion
The Bank Marketing Subscription Prediction System leverages machine learning to enhance the effectiveness of telemarketing campaigns, providing valuable insights and improving decision-making processes.
