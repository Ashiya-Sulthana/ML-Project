# ML-Project
The aim of this project is to use Machine Learning Techniques to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit offered by a bank through telemarketing campaigns.This project uses a dataset named Bank-direct-marketing-campaigns from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains information about the customer's personal and financial attributes,as well as the outcome of the previous and current contacts.The project performs exploratory data analysis,feature engineering,and model selection to build an ensemble classifier that combines different machine learning algorithms.The project evaluates the performance of the classifier using various metrics and compares it with other baseline models.This project also provides insights into the factors that influence the customer's decision and suggests ways to improve the effectiveness of the bank's marketing strategy.
